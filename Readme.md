# Simple Quote API

## Overview

This project is a simple RESTful API for managing quotes. It allows clients to retrieve a list of quotes and add new ones. The quotes are stored in an in-memory array, which means all data will be reset when the server restarts.

## Features

- `GET /quotes` – Retrieve all quotes
- `POST /quotes` – Add a new quote (basic validation required)

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Postman (for API testing)
